## gjvc-python-bootstrap

---

### synopsis

This is a template Python 3.x (3.13 by default, change it in `bin/settings`) project for getting a new idea working
quickly without wasting time on environmental setup. The intention is save you time during the first 10 hours and days,
not the first 10 months or years.

### assumptions

* You are running on Linux / UNIX.
* That you are using Python 3.13 from somewhere in your `${PATH}` environemnt variable (set in `bin/settings`)

### quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gjvc/gjvc-python-bootstrap.git
bin/dev-init
bin/app-main --help
```

### components

`pipdeptree` creates the `deptree` files, allowing for easy understanding of the package dependency hierarchy. It is
required and must not be removed. `cmd2` and `jurigged` make for a quietly powerful combination when
creating command-shell driven applications.  `jurigged` automatically reloads `.py` files during execution, in practice
between commands being issued at the `cmd2` prompt. This reduces the edit/test cycle time.

### managing dependencies

The essential packages required by a basic environment are listed at `etc/pip/3.13/bootstrap`:

<details>
<summary><code>etc/pip/3.13/bootstrap</code></summary>

```requirements
jurigged
pipdeptree
pyright
pytest
pyyaml
```
</details>

The root packages are listed at `etc/pip/3.13/root` in a flat list:

<details>
<summary><code>etc/pip/3.13/root</code></summary>

```requirements
cmd2==3.2.0
jurigged==0.6.1
pg8000==1.31.5
pipdeptree==2.30.0
psutil==7.2.2
pyright==1.1.408
pytest==9.0.2
PyYAML==6.0.3
```
</details>

The complete set of dependencies is listed, in an indented tree, at `etc/pip/3.13/deptree`. This is created by
`pipdeptree`:

### adding a package

```bash
bin/venv-pip3 install mypy
bin/dev-init
```

### removing a package

```bash
bin/venv-pip3 remove mypy
bin/dev-init
```

`bin/dev-init` regenerates the `root` and `deptree` files from the contents of the `.venv/` directory.

### project layout

| path               | purpose                                                            |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bin/app-main`     | application entry point (calls `src/python/main/app/main/main.py`) |
| `bin/app-tests`    | run the test suite                                                 |
| `bin/dev-init`     | create / recreate `.venv/` from requirements                       |
| `bin/dev-clean`    | clean the environment                                              |
| `bin/venv-python3` | run `.venv/bin/python3` with environment                           |
| `bin/venv-pip3`    | run `.venv/bin/pip3` with environment                              |
| `bin/venv-bin`     | run arbitrary executables from `.venv/bin/`                        |
| `src/python/main/` | source files for application                                       |
| `src/python/test/` | source files for tests                                             |

The naming conventions across `bin/` should be clear enough: `app-*` for entry points, `dev-*` for lifecycle, `venv-*`
for plumbing.

As an example to be followed, `bin/venv-pip3` and `bin/venv-python3` optionally pass additional arguments based on the
`JURIGGED` environment variable, enforcing uniform execution within the `.venv/` context.

`bin/app-main` has the option to pass additional environment variables as required.

### requirement files

Located under `etc/pip/3.13/`:

| file          | purpose                                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `bootstrap`   | minimal packages needed to create the venv itself       |
| `root`        | top-level project dependencies (what you edit)          |
| `deptree`     | full resolved dependency tree (generated by `dev-init`) |
| `pylock.toml` | lock file for reproducible installs                     |

### configuration

Where possible, configuration lives in `pyproject.toml` to avoid littering the project root.

### alternative tooling / approaches

This use of `pip`, `pipdeptree`, and `venv` is the minimal-but-complete set of tools required to manage a Python
virtual environment. Other tools exist to do this job, and they may well be faster, do more, and may be required,
depending on the scale of project you are managing. For instance, if you are a package maintainer you may wish to test
on multiple versions of Python 3, and `poetry` or `uv` will help you do so. On the other hand, if you only have to
maintain your personal application, and you have locally-installed versions of python on which you can rely, the
approach presented here may well suit you better without having to learn more expansive tooling.

| tool     | strengths                                      |
|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| `poetry` |                                                |
| `uv`     | very fast venv creation and package management |
| `pyenv`  |                                                |
| `pipx`   |                                                |

### possible future directions

* different project setups in different branches for the following project types
    * `django`
    * `fastapi`
    * `jupyter`
